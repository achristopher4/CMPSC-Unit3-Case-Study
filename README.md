Write a program that computes an investment report.

Analysis
The inputs to this program are the following:

An initial amount to be invested (a floating-point number)

A period of years (an integer)

An interest rate (a percentage expressed as an integer)

The program uses a simplified form of compound interest, in which the interest is computed once each year and added to the total amount invested. The output of the program is a report in tabular form that shows, for each year in the term of the investment, the year number, the initial balance in the account for that year, the interest earned for that year, and the ending balance for that year. The columns of the table are suitably labeled with a header in the first row. Following the output of the table, the program prints the total amount of the investment balance and the total amount of interest earned for the period.
